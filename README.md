# Computer-Simulation

## Summary
This course covered modeling of discrete-event dynamic systems and introduces simulationbased methods for using these models to solve engineering design and analysis problems. The syllabus can be found in the main directory within the repository. 

## Final Project
Our final project simulated a disease spread amungst students. Both the final project pdf and the supporting code is included.
