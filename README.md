# Computer-Simulation

## Summary
This course covered modeling of discrete-event dynamic systems and introduces simulationbased methods for using these models to solve engineering design and analysis problems. The syllabus can be found in the main directory within the repository. 

## Final Project
The final project was completed with Mohammed Siddiqui as my group partner. We simulated a disease spread amungst students. Both the final project pdf and the supporting code is included.

## The The 4 documents within the project tab are as follows:

#### Sim_Group_Project_Pandemic_Spread.ipynb
- This document contains all of the source code and visualizations discussed in the groups final report in Jupyter Notebook format. 
- The first 2 cells are used to install the necessary packages. If the distplot package is installed on your machine, that cell can be commented out.

#### Sim_Group_Project_Pandemic_Spread.py
- .py file containing the same information detailed above
- Python file PDF.pdf

#### .pdf file of Sim_Group_Project_Pandemic_Spread.ipynb

#### simulation group project.xlxs 
- Contains base case simulation performed in excel. The excel document contains the following tabs:
- Simulation: Spreadsheet for (1) run of the excel simulation
- 20 simulations: Seed was refreshed in the “Simulation” tab 20 times. This tab shows the results.
- Day 1 Expected Value: Calculates average of Day 1 Infected across all 20 simulations.
- Day 2 Expected Value: Calculates average of Day 2 Infected across all 20 simulations.
- Pandemic End: Histogram/supporting data for the end of the pandemic across all excel simulations.
- Students Susceptible and Recv’d: Average Infected, average recovered, and average susceptible students across 20 simulation runs.
- Average Infected by Date: Contains the same information as the Students Susceptible and Recv’d tab – not in table form.
- Sheet 6: Misc Excel Simulation
